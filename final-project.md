# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Final Project

### Overview

For the final project, you'll be designing and building a web app of your choice. This project will test your knowledge of JavaScript and ask you to apply everything you've learned in this course. The result will be a web app that you can add to your portfolio. You could create anything from: a blog users can comment on; an app that allows users to search for social media posts; or even an application that logs users locations. Work with your instructional team to create project goals that are realistic given the scope and timing of the class.

### Technical Requirements

- Create a single page application (SPA)
- Use at least one third-party API besides the OpenWeatherMap
- Use jQuery to perform DOM manipulation
- Use jQuery to listen for events and add interactivity based on user actions
- Use at least one JavaScript library besides jQuery, *e.g.* Underscore

__NOTE:__ Hosting your app is currently a bonus, but I reserve the right to make it a technical requirement.

---

### Bonuses
- Host on either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform)
- Include `CRUD` functionality
- Use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), a Backend-as-a-Service

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* working application that can be run locally
* 3-5 minute presentation including three technical hurdles and how you overcame them, two new things you learned, and Q&A.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Think of a problem in the world, or even in your personal life, and apply what you've learned to build an application that can help solve the issue.
- Research different social media, *e.g.* Instagram, APIs and see what kind of information you can use from them.
- Take a look at this list of public JSON APIs and see if any look particularly interesting: [https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
